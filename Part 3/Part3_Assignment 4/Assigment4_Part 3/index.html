        The page generates an interactive animation featuring multiple balls moving dynamically 
        within an HTML5 canvas. These balls exhibit behavior such as bouncing off the edges of 
        the canvas and changing colors upon collision with one another. The animation is achieved
        through JavaScript, which defines the properties and behavior of the balls, orchestrates 
        their movement, and manages collision detection. Users can observe the balls' movement 
        and interactions directly on the webpage, providing an engaging visual experience.
