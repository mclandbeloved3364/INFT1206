        The page creates an interactive animation where balls bounce around the canvas area. 
        Each ball has random colors, sizes, velocities, and positions. They bounce off the 
        edges of the canvas and change color when colliding with each other. Additionally, 
        there's an interactive "Evil Circle" controlled by arrow keys, which eliminates balls
        upon collision. The page dynamically updates the count of remaining balls. The animation
        loop continuously renders the scene, providing an engaging and interactive experience for users.
